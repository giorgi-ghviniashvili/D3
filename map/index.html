    <!-- Every two seconds (i.e. use setInterval function)...

    - Pop off one northern point, and one southern point.
    - Draw the northern and southern points on the map. Point should have a
    "callout" style label on top of it (not only on hover; it should
    automatically appear). Label should read like this: "RED event at CITY"
    (i.e. red is the class string, and city is the city string. Obviously if
    class is blue, then label will be "BLUE event at CITY".)
    - Points should not stay on the map forever. They should fade after a
    few seconds. So let's say every two seconds you draw two new points, but
    every point fades after three seconds.
    - The points should be animated - i.e. pulsating, etc.
    - IMPORTANT: when you reach the end of the lists... start over from the
    beginning of the list! (So in other words, copy the list. At start of
    function, check that your copies still have points. If they're empty,
    "recopy" the original lists and start popping off of there.) -->
